GF-TOKEN IS A PARTIAL DECENTRALIZED FINANCE WITH A VOTING SYSTEM IN ITS MAIN WEBSITE. ITS TOTAL SUPPLY WAS NOT DISTRIBUTED COMPLETELY ON CREATION, THIS IS MAJORLY BECAUSE IT WILL BE BASED ON INVESTORS DECISION THROUGH-OUT TIME WHETHER TO REACH ITS TOTAL SUPPLY CAP OR TO LEAVE ITS INITIAL CIRCULATING SUPPLY.

THIS IS THE GF MAIN SOURCE FILE. UPLOADED FOR DEVELOPERS TO READ AND CONFIRM IT WHENEVER THEY WANT.
ALTHOUGH IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHT-FORWARD.

DUE TO THE PRAGMA VERSION IT WAS WRITTEN WITH, ALWAYS OBSERVE THE COMPILER WHICH CAN DEPLOY THE CONTRACT. EITHER PARIS OR LONDON.
